# R Noah Padilla Map Reduce Report
## ABOUT
This programs main purpose is to perform the map reduce algorithm done in parallel in python.

## Problems Encountered and how I overcame them
The main issue that I was having was that OpenMP was having the shared dictionary sync with all the threads but could not get it going. I think this is because the OpenMP library is buggy thus leaving issues to the programmer like freezing or locking if the shared dictionary is instantiated outside of the parallel section. 
    
## Total Time Taken
Total time it took was ~10 hours because of the shared memory issue..

## Performance Measurements
The performance of the program was measured by taking the performance time 'time.time()'. The results are shown below in seconds. 


 * 1 thread: 0.1938166618347168


 * 2 threads: 0.24344372749328613


 * 4 threads: 0.2616910934448242


 * 8 threads: 2.1395139694213867


## Program Behavior
It seems that the performance peaked at about 2 threads and then declined. An output run for 1 thread looks like the below -

## Observations/Comments
I think that this assignment was good and way BETTER than the pymp assignment. I understood how it was working a lot more and also because it was less buggy than pymp. What I noticed was that the performance declined as the number of ranks/process increased. Another observation worth mentioning is how MPI executes the file - each thread executes the ENTIRE code over again whereas in pymp, the parallel section was the only part that repeated
